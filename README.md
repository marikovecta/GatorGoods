## Application built during CSC648

### What is this project?
This website was built as a part of CSC648 (Software Engineering) at SFSU, which attempted to simulate a real-world software company. In the class, we were divided into groups of around 6 and worked on a semester long project. The semester that I took the course, every team built a buy/sell website specifically tailored to SFSU students (think like craigslist). The team I participated in was a bit special, as half of our team was in San Francisco, and the other half was in Fulda, Germany. I served as our team's backend lead developer.

### Goals for the project
This project was mainly to serve as a learning experience. Not many of us had previous web development experience, and aside from techinical experience, none of us had practiced building a piece of software using User centered design and Agile mentality. 


### Results
Overall, the project didn't turn out quite as well as we all hoped, but we all learned a ton about working not only as a team in general, but as an international team. We faced quite a few roadblocks throughout the semester, but if I were to do this project again, the one thing I would change would be better communication. "Better communication" is fairly broad, so let me narrow that down to doing daily scrum meetings (virtually). There was a point during the semester where our team in San Francisco thought we were waiting on the team in Fulda to implement something, and they thought the same of us. This could have been avoided if we had been more open about our progress, what we were working on next, and what we were struggling with.
